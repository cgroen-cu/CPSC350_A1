Code limitations:
Incorrect file input will not return an error but will output a blank and incorrect output.

Additionally, I had used this link 
https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/descriptive-statistics/sample-variance/
To figure out the steps to calculating Variance and standard deviation.
However, now I see this website holds incorrect information, or at least incorrect in the
assignments context, and the steps to calculate the variance they offer are incorrect.
Therefore, my steps in the code to calculate the variance returns an incorrect variance, and
then an incorrect Standard Deviation.
